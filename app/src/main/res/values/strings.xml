You can change the available frequencies in the frequency table by changing this value.\nHowever, remember to make sure that the frequency can find the corresponding voltage in the voltage table, otherwise, it is impossible to boot the phone.\nThe unit of frequency here is Hz, that is to say, add 6 zeros after the MHz frequency. You can view the frequency in MHz in the previous menu. If you don\'t know how many zeros to add, it is recommended to modify only the first few digits of the number.\n</string>
    <string name="help_bus">This is probably the memory bus frequency related configuration corresponding to the GPU frequency.
